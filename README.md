Aim: Understanding the use of interface.
1. In order to simulate a smartphone OS system, implement the design stated below:
Write an interface Playable with the following abstract methods: void play(), void
stop(), void next() and void prev().
Write a class Radio that implements Playable. The class Radio represents a radio app to be
used in our smartphone. The class Radio has the following private data members: String
channelName, String programName and int volumeLevel. The class Radio defines
all the abstract methods of Playable interface. Write another class MusicPlayer that
implements Playable. The class MusicPlayer represents a music player app to be used in
our smartphone. The class MusicPlayer has the following private data members: String
artistName, String albumName, String songName, double songDuration
and int volumeLevel. The class MusicPlayer defines all the abstract methods of
Playable interface.
Write another interface Trackable with the following abstract method: getCoordinates().
Write a class GPSApp that implements Trackable. The class GPSApp represents a location
tracker application to be used in our smartphone. The class GPSApp has the following private data
members: float xCoordinate, float yCoordinate, int hour and int minutes.
The class GPSApp defines the method getCoordinates(). Write another class WeatherApp
that implements Trackable. The class WeatherApp represents a weather condition
application to be used in our smartphone. The class WeatherApp has the following private data
members: String city, enum currentForecast and enum tomorrowsForecast.
The class WeatherApp defines the method getCoordinates().
Write a class Phone. The class Phone has the following private data members: String model;
int modelYear, MusicPlayer player, Radio radio, GPSApp gps and
WeatherApp weather.
2. Write a class SmartphoneApp that contains the following public static methods: void
displayMenu(), and void main(String[] args). displayMenu method will display
a sample menu to the user to use the applications in the phone.
In main, at first, construct a new Phone instance and set the corresponding class members
accordingly. You can also create many test instances from Phone class by specifying different
smartphones. After this part, display the menu options to the user. According to the selection of the
user, simulate the necessary actions for particular applications. For example, if the user selects option
1 to use weather application, the program must display a sample weather condition to the user. You
can simulate other apps similarly.
Write the program in such a manner that the program reads an integer value from the user among the
option numbers in menu. It is expected that the user would enter a number; but what if the user enters
a different character or a string? Discuss.
